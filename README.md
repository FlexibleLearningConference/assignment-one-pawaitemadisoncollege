# GitHub Education Assignment 1

Example assignment created for the *GitHub in the Classroom* talk which you can use as a "Getting Started" guide for GitHub for Education. 


- [ ] Set up a free GitHub account. You probably already did that if you are here, but if not, follow the steps [here]( https://help.github.com/categories/setup/) to sign up.

- [ ] [Request](https://education.github.com) the educator discount. Choose individual account, rather than organization. An organization account would be for an entire company or school.

- [ ] [Create](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/) an organization for your class.

- [ ] [Create](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) a classroom. I generally create one classroom for each organization/class.

- [ ] [Watch videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChA_zph7aao) to learn more about GitHub Classroom.

- [ ] [Create](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) your first assignment in one of your classrooms.

- [ ] Extra Challenge: [Create your own website](https://pages.github.com).

- [ ] Let me know if you have questions or would like to share your experience with GitHub! [pawaite@madisconcollege.edu](mailto:pawaite@madisoncollege.edu)
